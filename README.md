# SampleSwiftWeather

1st version of a sample weather iOS app. 

It's all started here. A clean and base weather app made with:

- Only 1 screen which display current weather info for a desired town
- MVC architecture
- Using classic libraries like Reusable, RXSwift, Reachability. 
This app has been provided in my company as iOS TP

This first project leads to other ones with several improvements and architecture updates
